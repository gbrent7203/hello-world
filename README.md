In this course, I hope to have gained basic knowledge of how to code, how to use Visual studio and Github, and how to use them to make a website. When I was little, I had made my first website with a website application. I remember thinking how cool it was to have my own website and was curious about how websites were actually made. Even though that application didn't require coding, it made me more interested in how web developers had actually made websites by themselves. I hope to make a Website that I can look at and be proud of since I had no prior knowledge before I enrolled in Web Development & Internet Applications program.
